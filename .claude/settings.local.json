Inspired by Hirokazu Kore-eda contemplative cinema. Scene 1 \\(0-4 seconds\\): A wide shot with a completely static camera. In the left foreground, white and pink plum blossoms bloom in full glory on delicate branches. In the right background, a young Japanese woman stands with her back to the camera, a small solitary figure. Deep depth of field keeps both the plum blossoms and the woman in sharp focus. Soft overcast diffused light creates even, gentle illumination with minimal shadows and muted tones. Everything is still for the first two seconds, then a gentle breeze begins, and plum petals start drifting slowly through the air. The womans hair and the hem of her light coat sway slightly in the wind. Scene 2 \\(4-10 seconds\\): Same fixed camera position. A rack focus shifts from the plum blossoms to the womans back, transitioning from deep to shallow depth of field. The foreground plum blossoms dissolve into beautiful cinematic bokeh, and scattered petals crossing the frame become soft particles of light. The woman stands motionless for several seconds, then her shoulders subtly drop and her head tilts slightly downward -- a barely perceptible gesture of sorrow conveyed entirely through her back. The wind gradually intensifies, increasing the flow of falling petals around her still figure. Photorealistic, minimalist composition, static camera throughout with absolutely no camera movement. Overcast diffused natural light, muted cool tones, professional color grading. Subtle film grain texture. Rack focus as the sole cinematic technique. Contemplative and melancholic mood, wabi-sabi aesthetic, lyrical atmosphere. 8k resolution, Japanese cinema sensibility.''; \\($text -split ''\\\\s+''\\).Count\")"
