# Project Rules

## Communication Language
- **Japanese (日本語)**: All communication, comments, and documentation must be in Japanese unless explicitly requested otherwise by the user.
- **Agent Responses**: The agent must always respond in Japanese.

## Workflow Adherence
- Follow defined workflows in `.agent/workflows/` when applicable.
- **Finish Work**: When declaring "work finished" (作業終了), execute the `finish_work` workflow to sync with GitHub.
